## About Me

*Welcome to my GitHub profile!*

I'm currently attending a full stack bootcamp at the University of Central Florida.  My primary focus includes 3rd-party API's, mySQL databases, Express and Node.js.  I also enjoy creating polished front-ends via CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Tailwind and Bulma.
